  abstract = {Current state-of-the-art decision tree algorithms, such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART), build the decision tree using a recursive approach based on a greedy heuristic. We study the benefits of an optimal decision tree approach, which creates the entire decision tree at once using Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO). While such problems are known to be hard to solve for large instances, we leverage modern solver techniques that are able to obtain near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. The methodology is able to handle both single-feature splits, as in CART, and also hyperplane splits that use multiple features. We test optimal regression trees on a host of synthetic datasets and optimal classification tress on a novel application concerning the usage of CT imagining to diagnose head injuries in children. Our results demonstrate that optimal trees lead to a significantly greater accuracy than CART.},

  abstract = {Introduction:~           The effect of mental health on patient-reported outcome measures is not fully understood in total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Thus, we investigated the relationship between mental health diagnoses (MHDs) and the Minimal Clinically Important Difference for Improvement (MCID-I) and Worsening (MCID-W) in primary TJA and revision TJA (rTJA).           Methods:~           Retrospective data were collected using relevant Current Procedural Terminology and MHDs International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes with completed Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form, Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Physical Function Short Form 10a, PROMIS Global-Mental, or PROMIS Global-Physical questionnaires. Logistic regressions and statistical analyses were used to determine the effect of a MHD on MCID-I/MCID-W rates.           Results:~           Data included 4,562 patients (4,190 primary TJAs/372 rTJAs). In primary total hip arthroplasty (pTHA), MHD-affected outcomes for Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short Form (MCID-I: 81\% versus 86\%, P = 0.007; MCID-W: 6.0\% versus 3.2\%, P = 0.008), Physical Function Short Form 10a (MCID-I: 68\% versus 77\%, P {$<$} 0.001), PROMIS Global-Mental (MCID-I: 38\% versus 44\%, P = 0.009), and PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 61\% versus 73\%, P {$<$} 0.001; MCID-W: 14\% versus 7.9\%, P {$<$} 0.001) versus pTHA patients without MHD. A MHD led to lower rates of MCID-I for PROMIS Global-Physical (MCID-I: 56\% versus 63\%, P = 0.003) in primary total knee arthroplasty patients. No effects from a MHD were observed in rTJA patients.           Discussion:~           The presence of a MHD had a prominent negative influence on pTHA patients. Patients who underwent rTJA had lower MCID-I rates, higher MCID-W rates, and lower patient-reported outcome measure scores despite less influence from a MHD.           Level of evidence:~           Level III, retrospective comparative study.},

  abstract = {Background Complex machine learning (ML) models have revolutionized predictions in clinical care. However, for laparoscopic colectomy (LC), prediction of morbidity by ML has not been adequately analyzed nor compared against traditional logistic regression (LR) models. Methods All LC patients, between 2017 and 2019, in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) were identified. A composite outcome of 17 variables defined any post-operative morbidity. Seven of the most common complications were additionally analyzed. Three ML models (Random Forests, XGBoost, and L1-L2-RFE) were compared with LR. Results Random Forests, XGBoost, and L1-L2-RFE predicted 30-day post-operative morbidity with average area under the curve (AUC): .709, .712, and .712, respectively. LR predicted morbidity with AUC = .712. Septic shock was predicted with AUC ≤ .9, by ML and LR. Conclusion There was negligible difference in the predictive ability of ML and LR in post-LC morbidity prediction. Possibly, the computational power of ML cannot be realized in limited datasets.},

  abstract = {Background The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, have caused worldwide disruption, leading countries to take drastic measures to address the progression of the disease. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, hospitals are struggling to allocate resources to patients who are most at risk. In this context, it has become important to develop models that can accurately predict the severity of infection of hospitalized patients to help guide triage, planning, and resource allocation. Objective The aim of this study was to develop accurate models to predict the mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using basic demographics and easily obtainable laboratory data. Methods We performed a retrospective study of 375 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The patients were randomly split into derivation and validation cohorts. Regularized logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers were trained on the derivation cohort, and accuracy metrics (F1 scores) were computed on the validation cohort. Two types of models were developed: the first type used laboratory findings from the entire length of the patient’s hospital stay, and the second type used laboratory findings that were obtained no later than 12 hours after admission. The models were further validated on a multicenter external cohort of 542 patients. Results Of the 375 patients with COVID-19, 174 (46.4\%) died of the infection. The study cohort was composed of 224/375 men (59.7\%) and 151/375 women (40.3\%), with a mean age of 58.83 years (SD 16.46). The models developed using data from throughout the patients’ length of stay demonstrated accuracies as high as 97\%, whereas the models with admission laboratory variables possessed accuracies of up to 93\%. The latter models predicted patient outcomes an average of 11.5 days in advance. Key variables such as lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and percentage of lymphocytes in the blood were indicated by the models. In line with previous studies, age was also found to be an important variable in predicting mortality. In particular, the mean age of patients who survived COVID-19 infection (50.23 years, SD 15.02) was significantly lower than the mean age of patients who died of the infection (68.75 years, SD 11.83; P{$<$}.001). Conclusions Machine learning models can be successfully employed to accurately predict outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Our models achieved high accuracies and could predict outcomes more than one week in advance; this promising result suggests that these models can be highly useful for resource allocation in hospitals.},
