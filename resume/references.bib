  abstract = {Background Despite the effectiveness of total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}), patients often have lingering pain and dysfunction. Recent studies have raised concerns that preoperative mental health may negatively affect outcomes after {TKA}. The primary aim of this study investigates the relationship between patient-reported mental health and postoperative physical function following {TKA}. Methods A retrospective study of 1392 primary {TKA} patients was performed. Mental health and physical function scores were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ({PROMIS}) Global Health, and {PROMIS} Physical Function 10a and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Physical Function ({KOOS}-{PS}) short forms. These assessments were completed preoperatively and up to 1-year postoperatively. Patients were stratified based on preoperative mental health scores into five distinct categories ranging from “Poor” to “Excellent.” Locally estimated scatter plot smoothing curves ({LOESS}) were fit to the data examining physical function score trends over time. Results Patients with higher mental health scores before surgery demonstrated better preoperative and postoperative physical function scores. However, all patients experienced similar gains in physical function following surgery. Despite this early improvement, patients with the worst mental health scores experienced a sharp decline in physical function approximately a year after surgery and did not appear to recover. Conclusions Poor mental health should not be a contraindication for performing {TKA}. For patients with the lowest mental health scores, physicians should account for the possibility that physical function scores may deteriorate a year after surgery. Tighter follow-up guidelines, more frequent physical therapy visits, or treatment for mental health issues may be considered to counter such deterioration.},

  abstract = "Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, have caused worldwide disruption, leading countries
    to take drastic measures to address the progression of the disease. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, hospitals are struggling to allocate resources to patients who are most at risk. In this context, it has become important to develop models that can accurately predict the severity of infection of hospitalized patients to help guide triage, planning, and resource allocation. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop accurate models to predict the mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using basic demographics and easily obtainable laboratory data. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 375 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The patients were randomly split into derivation and validation cohorts. Regularized logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers were trained on the derivation cohort, and accuracy metrics (F1 scores) were computed on the validation cohort. Two types of models were developed: the first type used laboratory findings from the entire length of the patient's hospital stay, and the second type used laboratory findings that were obtained no later than 12 hours after admission. The models were further validated on a multicenter external cohort of 542 patients. Results: Of the 375 patients with COVID-19, 174 (46.4{\%}) died of the infection. The study cohort was composed of 224/375 men (59.7{\%}) and 151/375 women (40.3{\%}), with a mean age of 58.83 years (SD 16.46). The models developed using data from throughout the patients' length of stay demonstrated accuracies as high as 97{\%}, whereas the models with admission laboratory variables possessed accuracies of up to 93{\%}. The latter models predicted patient outcomes an average of 11.5 days in advance. Key variables such as lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and percentage of lymphocytes in the blood were indicated by the models. In line with previous studies, age was also found to be an important variable in predicting mortality. In particular, the mean age of patients who survived COVID-19 infection (50.23 years, SD 15.02) was significantly lower than the mean age of patients who died of the infection (68.75 years, SD 11.83; P<.001). Conclusions: Machine learning models can be successfully employed to accurately predict outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Our models achieved high accuracies and could predict outcomes more than one week in advance; this promising result suggests that these models can be highly useful for resource allocation in hospitals.

	abstract = {Current state-of-the-art decision tree algorithms, such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART), build the decision tree using a recursive approach based on a greedy heuristic. We study the benefits of an optimal decision tree approach, which creates the entire decision tree at once using Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO). While such problems are known to be hard to solve for large instances, we leverage modern solver techniques that are able to obtain near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. The methodology is able to handle both single-feature splits, as in CART, and also hyperplane splits that use multiple features. We test optimal regression trees on a host of synthetic datasets and optimal classification tress on a novel application concerning the usage of CT imagining to diagnose head injuries in children. Our results demonstrate that optimal trees lead to a significantly greater accuracy than CART.},
