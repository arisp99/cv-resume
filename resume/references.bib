	abstract = {Current state-of-the-art decision tree algorithms, such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART), build the decision tree using a recursive approach based on a greedy heuristic. We study the benefits of an optimal decision tree approach, which creates the entire decision tree at once using Mixed Integer Optimization (MIO). While such problems are known to be hard to solve for large instances, we leverage modern solver techniques that are able to obtain near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. The methodology is able to handle both single-feature splits, as in CART, and also hyperplane splits that use multiple features. We test optimal regression trees on a host of synthetic datasets and optimal classification tress on a novel application concerning the usage of CT imagining to diagnose head injuries in children. Our results demonstrate that optimal trees lead to a significantly greater accuracy than CART.},

	abstract = {Background
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, have caused worldwide disruption, leading countries to take drastic measures to address the progression of the disease. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, hospitals are struggling to allocate resources to patients who are most at risk. In this context, it has become important to develop models that can accurately predict the severity of infection of hospitalized patients to help guide triage, planning, and resource allocation.

Objective
The aim of this study was to develop accurate models to predict the mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using basic demographics and easily obtainable laboratory data.

Methods
We performed a retrospective study of 375 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The patients were randomly split into derivation and validation cohorts. Regularized logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers were trained on the derivation cohort, and accuracy metrics (F1 scores) were computed on the validation cohort. Two types of models were developed: the first type used laboratory findings from the entire length of the patient’s hospital stay, and the second type used laboratory findings that were obtained no later than 12 hours after admission. The models were further validated on a multicenter external cohort of 542 patients.

Results
Of the 375 patients with COVID-19, 174 (46.4\%) died of the infection. The study cohort was composed of 224/375 men (59.7\%) and 151/375 women (40.3\%), with a mean age of 58.83 years (SD 16.46). The models developed using data from throughout the patients’ length of stay demonstrated accuracies as high as 97\%, whereas the models with admission laboratory variables possessed accuracies of up to 93\%. The latter models predicted patient outcomes an average of 11.5 days in advance. Key variables such as lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and percentage of lymphocytes in the blood were indicated by the models. In line with previous studies, age was also found to be an important variable in predicting mortality. In particular, the mean age of patients who survived COVID-19 infection (50.23 years, SD 15.02) was significantly lower than the mean age of patients who died of the infection (68.75 years, SD 11.83; P{\textless}.001).

Conclusions
Machine learning models can be successfully employed to accurately predict outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Our models achieved high accuracies and could predict outcomes more than one week in advance; this promising result suggests that these models can be highly useful for resource allocation in hospitals.},
